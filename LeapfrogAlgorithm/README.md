Global Truncation Error of Leapfrog and Euler Cromer Methods
============================================================

This is an addition to the SHO 'nough project. It contains a main function which plots solutions by Euler Cromer and Leapfrog algorithms to the simple harmonic oscillator problem. To run the main function, just run 

python leapfrog/main.py

from the project root. It's simple. The code has function docstrings to describe required parameters and returns, and it's written in Python so it reads basically like English.
